# Angular Task Management

## Overview

Angular Task Management is a simple web application developed using Angular. The application allows users to create and delete tasks. The latest updates are stored in the browser's memory, ensuring that the task list is retained even after a page refresh.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Users can create new tasks and assign them descriptions.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage**: The application stores the latest updates in the browser's local storage, so changes persist across page reloads.

## Installation
